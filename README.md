# Field o' Fiends
Deep in the forest near a small, hidden town lies a cursed field. 
In this field, one day every year, everything comes to life.
This year, you have been chosen as the brave soul who must clear the fields.
Never has a tribute made it back in one piece....

When you enter the field you will learn why they say it is cursed. 
It seems that the critters here change between hyper-aggressive and peaceful and chill every ten seconds.... what's up with that?
